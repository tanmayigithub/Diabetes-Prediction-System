A Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning is a software application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on input health parameters. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze clinical and lifestyle data such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and family history of diabetes. The system processes the data, applies predictive models, and outputs the risk level of diabetes (e.g., high, moderate, or low). This system can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and individuals in taking preventive measures, promoting better health outcomes through data-driven insights.
